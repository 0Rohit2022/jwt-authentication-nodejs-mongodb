# jwt-authentication-nodejs-mongodb


In this project, I added jwt authentication in which if a user register and after that he go for log in then and only then he/she can access the dashboard section.
If the user didn't register then he/she will not access the dashboard.
I used jwt token with cookies and On the dashboard page if the user click on the logout button then he will be redirected on the home page.
